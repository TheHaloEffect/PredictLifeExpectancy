# Description
A Multivariable Regression model that predicts life expectancy given other variables. Used a Kaggle dataset that has data on many countries, regarding GDP, population, infant/adult mortality, life expectancy etc. It was an attempt to try out the machine learning knowledge that I have been teaching myself. Some variables seemed to have very high P-Values so I removed some from the model and compared the BIC and R-Squared values to the original full model and got a better result.
